<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vertex class contains information about one Vector.

An instance can be constructed by passing in a Vertex representing the
the destination of the Vector and another representing the origin:
$orig1 = new Vertex( array( 'x' => 23.87, 'y' => -37.95, 'z' => 78.34 ) );
$dest1 = new Vertex( array( 'x' => -12.34, 'y' => 23.45, 'z' => -34.56 ) );
$vec  = new Vector( array( 'orig' => $orig1, 'dest' => $dest1 ) );

The w component of a Vector will always be set to 0.0 to facilitate
calculations with matrices.

If no origin Vertex is specified, the default origin will be set to
x = 0
y = 0
z = 0

The components can only be read and not set, therefore Vector contains only
getters. However, there are a number of useful methods within the class:

float magnitude(): Returns the magnitude of the Vector.
Vector normalize(): Returns a new, normalized Vector.
Vector add( Vector $rhs ): Returns the addition of two vectors.
Vector sub( Vector $rhs ): Returns the subtraction of two vectors.
Vector opposite(): Returns the Vector with inverted values.
Vector scalarProduct( $k ): Returns the scalar product of two Vectors.
float dotProduct( Vector $rhs ): Returns the dot product of two Vectors.
float cos( Vector $rhs ): Returns the cosine of the angle between Vectors.
Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ): Returns the cross product of two Vectors.
